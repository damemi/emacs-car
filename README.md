# emacs-car
I have a hard time hitting the Ctrl key for all the emacs bindings so I made some minor re-mappings using [QJoyPad](http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/) and a [Logitech G920](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/dp/B00Z0UWV98)


Here's a demo video:

Keymappings:
```
Steer left:        <left arrow>
Steer right:       <right arrow>
Paddle shift up:   <up arrow>
Paddle shift down: <down arrow>
Gas:               <Ctrl>
Clutch:            <Meta>
Brake:             Unmapped (speed baby)

Gears:
1st:   X
2nd:   S
3rd:   W
4th:   Y
5th:   G
6th:   <space>
R:     /
```

## Has anyone thought of this before?
